			<h1>Figure Skating Conditions in South Korea</h1>

					<p>From the perimeter of a small country, South Korean athletes are increasingly entering foreign professional leagues. They are becoming more present in the United States and also in European countries in a range of sports: baseball, soccer, golf, figure-skating, gymnastics and archery just to name a few. Korean baseball players are increasingly entering the American Major League Baseball, showing promise in positions like pitchers and shortstops. But for younger athletes, those who are up-and-coming in South Korea, many are traveling abroad to train and further hone their skills. The United States and England are the most coveted nations for South Korea's athletes.</p>

				<p>Take a look into the sport of figure-skating. Yuna Kim is the first South korean female skater to win the Olympic Games, the World Championships, the Four Continents Championships and the Grand Prix Final. She holds the reign as being one of most artistic and best-technique skater, leading her to have the highest combined total score for a short and free program under the International Skating Union judging system. But how did she start her skating career? </p>

				<p>Yuna Kim started her skating career at age 7. She skated alongside her older sister, but a coach later approached Kim and her mother telling her of Kim's potential.
				<p>At the age of 16, Kim traveled to Canada to train under former Olympic medalist and Canadian, Brian Orser. Kim's choreographer, David Wilson, is also Canadian. </p>
				<p>She spent summers training in Canada, where rinks were warm enough for Kim to dress in lighter clothes, allowing a smoother skating repertoire. </p>
				<p> The number of ice rinks in South Korea are very limited, often pushing young figure skaters to travel all over and outside of Seoul in order to train. </p>
				<p>There are a totaly of 12 rinks in Seoul, but only six of them are open year around. THe other six, which are open only during the winter season are also open to the public for holiday skating. Many of these winter-only rinks are part of hotels or theme parks, which are not the most favorable for professional athletes. </p>

			<div class="float-right">
				<p>Ice rink conditions are crucial in the performance and safety of a figure skater. Rinks located throughout Seoul are often public arenas, preventing athletes to have the space and freedom needed to train. Private training sessions are limited, as they are expensive, in addition to hard to come by as they limit the public from having their enjoyment. Rinks like that of Lotte World Theme Park's are not designed and maintained for professional athletes.</p>

				<p> When training for large competitions, like the Olympics, it is crucial for figure skaters to take in the size and alter their choreography according to the conditions of the competition's rinks. Hence, giving reason for atheltes like Kim, to train in better and larger facilities in cities where where winter sports are more common. </p>

				<p>In an interview with CNN, Kim discussed her training experience in South Korea. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="quotes">
				<p>"During my early skating years, there were not many ice rinks in Korea and even the few rinks that existed, most of them were public. Even now, when athletes want to practice, they have to use the rink very early [in the] morning or late at night.</p>
				
				<p>Also, as there aren't enough ice rinks to facilitate all the figure skating teams, skaters often have to train in different rinks from day to day. Furthermore, as most rinks are too cold, there is always high possibility of injury. As there were no rinks for competitive figure skaters, I found it most difficult to carry on a normal day life as I had to train very early in the morning and late at night."</p>

				<p>Yuna Kim began her career performing in front of empty bleachers, but as she gained more traction as a reputable and high-class athlete, figure-skating in South Korea has gained more traction. Rinks were practically empty of skaters, but now South Korea has a growing national team of men and women figure skaters and is in the process of building more rinks. 
				
				<p>The 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics may be the key component to building more facilities catered to the winter sports, figure skating included.
